# Your Portfolio (Wix-style one page)

## How to deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new public repo named **YOUR-USERNAME.github.io** (use your actual GitHub username).
2. Upload the files from this zip. Make sure `index.html` is in the repo root.
3. Open `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io` in a browser.

### Editing later
- Edit `index.html` directly on GitHub (press the pencil icon), or clone the repo locally, edit, and push.
- Changes publish automatically. Hard-refresh your browser if you don't see them.

### Personalise
- Replace text like `Your Name`, phone, email, and links.
- Replace images: `hero.jpg`, `portrait.jpg`, `project1.jpg`, `project2.jpg`, `project3.jpg`.
- Add your resume as `Your_Resume.pdf` (or update the filename in the HTML).
- If you want the contact form to work, create a free Formspree form and replace the `action` URL in the HTML.

### Optional
- Custom domain: in repo Settings → Pages → Custom domain (add a CNAME at your domain registrar).
